Purpose
-------

This Plugin enables VDR to create standard compliant DVDs from VDR SD recordings
while being able to control the process and to watch progress from inside VDRs
on-screen-display. If the selected recordings don't fit onto the DVD, the video
tracks are requantized (shrinked) automatically.

The created menus support multipage-descriptions (in case the recording description
exceeds one page).

requant_lxdvdrip            => 1.77     http://sourceforge.net/projects/lxdvdrip/

requant (http://metakine.com/files) and tcrequant (formerly part of transcode) seem to be discontinued and are therefore no longer recommended

for optional subtitle support:
pxsup2dast                              http://www.guru-group.fi/~too/sw/m2vmp2cut/



Installation
------------

1. Untar the archive inside VDR's plugin-source folder

   # tar xvfz -C PLUGINS/src vdr-burn-0.3.0.tgz

2. Install the required development packages of boost and GD.

3. Recompile Plugins

   # make plugins-clean plugins

   If your VDR is patched for teletext subtitles (see ttxtsubs plugin) then the
   burn plugin will automatically be compiled with teletext subtitle support.
   DVB subtitle support is always compiled in.

   Optionally you can change some defaults:
   - default temporary folder   BURN_TMPDIR (default: /tmp) must be a UNIX filesystem
   - default DVD writer device  BURN_DVDDEV (default: /dev/dvdrw)
   - default ISO directory      BURN_ISODIR (default: /pub/export)

   e.g.:
   # make BURN_DVDDEV=/dev/cdrecorder BURN_ISODIR=/export plugins

4. Install Plugins

   # make install-plugins

   This will install the plugin library, scripts, config files and resources into
   the locations defined by VDR.
   Please adapt the settings in <CONFIG>/plugins/vdrburn-dvd.conf to reflect
   the correct Java and Project X jar file.
   
5. (optional) Create a directory "skins" in "plugins/burn" inside your VDR
   resource directory. Create sub-directories for each skin you'd like
   to be offered by the plugin. Place menu-bg.png and/or menu-button.png files
   inside to use them as skins for the menus of your DVDs.

   # mkdir <RESOURCE>/plugins/burn/skins
   # mkdir <RESOURCE>/plugins/burn/skins/Star_Trek_TNG
   # cp ~/images/star_trek_pal.png \
           <RESOURCE>/plugins/burn/skins/Star_Trek_TNG/menu-bg.png


Parameters
----------

The plugin accepts the following parameters at the VDR command line:

  -t DIR,   --tempdir=DIR   use DIR for temporary files
                            MUST be on UNIX filesystem
                            (default: /tmp)
  -d DIR,   --datadir=DIR   use DIR for temporary datafiles
                            (default: /var/spool/video)
  -D DEV    --dvd=DEV       use DEV as DVD Writer
                            (default: /dev/dvdrw)
  -i DIR    --iso=DIR       use DIR to store ISO images
                            (default: /pub/export)

So when you want your ISO images stored on /largefiles and use dvd writer
/dev/sr0 then the VDR start command line should look like this:

  /usr/sbin/vdr -P"burn -i /largefiles -D /dev/sr0"

If you are using precompiled packages as delivered by distributions have a look
at the distributions docu where the command line arguments need to be entered.

Usage
-----

When starting VDR and the Plugin, you can specify the directory where the
temporary files will reside, your DVD writer device, and optionally a
directory where the optional ISO is placed. If you specify both a dvd writer
and an iso directory here or at compile time (see 3. above), you can choose
in the OSD what actions the plugin will take (create an ISO, burn on-the-fly,
or do both). Additionally, you have to define a temporary directory and a data
directory. The temporary directory MUST reside on a filesystem capable of
handling symlinks and fifos (which all UNIX filesystems do, but not VFAT),
while the data directory must reside on a filesystem with enough free disk
space. See vdr -P burn -h for a syntax explanation.

To start a new DVD Project, enter the burn menu from VDR's main menu and you'll
see all your VDR recordings. You can navigate as usual through folders. Press
the "red" button to select a recording for burning. Selected recordings do
no longer appear in the list. Recordings recognized as HD recordings will be
displayed but are not selectable.
The total size of the selected recodings is shown in the upper bar. Be sure not
to select too many recordings to fit onto one DVD. Shrinking works best when
the recording should only be a few percent smaller.

After finishing the selection you can switch to the job view with the "blue"
button. You will see an overview of the selected recordings along with some
additional information.
On each recording entry you can press "enter" to get into the tracks submenu.
Here you can choose another name for this recording in the DVD main menu with
the "red" button. You can choose between:
  * EPG title
  * EPG title - EPG short text  (if short text exists in recordings info file)
  * EPG short text              (if short text exists in recordings info file)
  * recording name as it is stored on disk

Not all selections may be available for all recordings e.g. if there is no
short text defined in EPG only the EPG title and recording name appear (and are
usually identical). By selecting an entry and pressing the ok button the text
is copied to the track menu. It can still be edited by  pressing the "right"
button. Editing is done as known from other VDR menus (like when editing
channel names). Press "Ok" to confirm and save the recording title or press
"back" to discard the changes.

Below the title all tracks of that recording are listed. For the video track
you can choose the aspect ratio, for audio and subtitle tracks you can choose
if they should be taken over to the DVD and correct the language if neccessary
(be careful to leave the video and at least one audio track active).
Press "Ok" to get back to the previous menu with all selected recordings.

There you can edit the disc title by selecting the entry below all recordings
and pressing the "right" button. Editing is done as known from other VDR menus
(like when editing channel names). Press "Ok" to confirm and save the title.

Under job settings you can change several settings for this one job like the
burn target (DVD or ISO image), the menu skin, chapter marks and if the
cutting marks should be taken into account during conversion.
The second possible DVD type, "Archive-Disc", just burns the VDR recording
structure onto the DVD without shrinking, useful in conjunction with the
Media-Detection Plugin, which can detect and play such discs. Please be aware
that Archive-DVD is currently not actively maintained and is only provided as-is.
With "Ok" you confirm the settings an get back to the previous menu.

From the recording list you can also re-order the selected recordings by moving
one down with the "green" button and delete it from the list with the "yellow"
button. To add additional recordings switch to the recording list (two times
"blue" button) and select them there.

Between the recording titles and the disc info, you see a progressbar which
shows how much space the recordings would consume on a 4,7GB DVD+-R(W). If
space exceeds a limit, an additional warning "Recordings could be shrinked!"
is displayed.

Pressing the "red" button will start the conversion and launch several
processes in the background. If you place an empty DVD+-R(W) into your DVD
writer, the job will run and finish, and after some time (depending on the
speed of your computer) the tray will open and the disc is finished. Anyway,
you will be asked to place an empty disc into the drive if you forget it.

You will notice that the display changes after you pressed the "red" button.
You can switch through all displays using the "blue" button. This way you
can enqueue additional jobs while one job is processed. In the status display,
you can also see a hint on the progress (although the bar is not too precise)
and whether a job crashed for some reason. If a job is marked as "crashed",
you could find the coresponding logfile in <BURN_ISODIR>/vdrburn-<dvd title>.log
for examination, which requires command line access to the VDR.
All intermediate files (including logs) are deleted if you remove the erroneous
job from the status display (using the "yellow" button). You can also re-edit
canceled or crashed jobs to alter the settings and try again with the "green"
button.

Hints
-----
* Do not shrink to much as this will produce artifacts.
* if mplex fails with "too many buffer underruns" but the recordings plays
  fine in VDR then you might suffer from too restrict error handling in mplex
  as discussed here:
  http://www.vdr-portal.de/board16-video-disk-recorder/board99-distributionen/board96-yavdr/p917494-0-2-problem-mit-burn-plugin/#post917494
  The patch mjpegtools-2.0.0-mplex-underruns.diff in the patches folder fixes
  this.
* If mplex does not find an audio track like here:
     [mplex] **ERROR: [mplex] Unable to read from ....../VDRSYNC.0/.
  then your Project X is likely to old.
  Check your Project X version in the logfile, it should to be 0.91.0 or higher !

Caveats
-------
- No transcoding is done (will fail with non-DVD-compliant DVB-streams)
- does not support HD recordings or creating Blu-ray discs; only SD recordings
  on DVDs are supported
